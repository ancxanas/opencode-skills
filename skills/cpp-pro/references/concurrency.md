| std::atomic | Simple shared state | Lock-free |
| std::mutex | Exclusive access | Kernel call |
| std::shared_mutex | Read-heavy workload | Better than mutex |
| Lock-free structures | High contention | Best throughput |
| Thread pool | Task parallelism | Avoid thread overhead |
| Parallel STL | Data parallelism | Automatic scaling |
| std::async | Simple async tasks | Thread pool |
| Coroutines | Async I/O | Minimal overhead |
